# Basic Calculator

This is my first project in Python! üéâ  
The **Basic Calculator** is a simple command-line tool that performs basic mathematical operations.

## Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/logan/<repository-name>.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd <repository-name>

3. Run the calculator script
   python calculator.py

Follow the prompts to input your numbers and choose the desired operation.

Example

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): +
Result: 15


Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Future Improvements
Add support for advanced operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
Add input validation to handle invalid entries gracefully.
